      li.about
        p Confr is a webapp that allows you to connect with other conference attendees prior to the conference. We match you up with other attendees based on similar interests and experiences, to help reduce the awkwardness of networking at conferences.
        p To use Confr simply just:
        ul
          li Click on the link: www.confr.us
          li Log-in with your LinkedIn account info
          li Join the conference youâ€™ll be attending
          li See people who share similar experiences and interests as you
        p What's next? - Now, you can either send attendees a message, use their picture to find them at the conference, or just view their full LinkedIn profile ahead of time. The idea is to provide "icebreakers" that give attendees something in common to start a conversation with. We suggest you log in periodically up until the conference, to check to see who else has joined.
